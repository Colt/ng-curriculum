#Angular Reddit Clone

It's time to put everything you've learned so far about Angular to use.  You're going to make a reddit clone with posts, comments, searching, sorting, animations, and more! Watch the following video for an in-depth walk-through of the features.

Requirements:

* Each post has a title, author, image, and description.
* Each post's date/time is displayed nicely: "Yesterday at 3:09pm", "Last Thursday at 4:42am", etc. You will need an external library. Watch the video for more details.  
* A user can upvote/downvote posts
* Posts dynamically reorder according to number of votes
* A user can create new posts
* A user cannot create a new post if any of the 4 inputs are blank.  Research angular validations.  See the video for an example implementation.
* A user can click to view existing comments on a specific post
* The number of comments is correctly pluralized
* A user can add a new comment to a specific post
* The new post form and comment forms can be toggled on and off
* A user can search through posts
* A user can sort posts by votes, date, and title.
* Animate posts as they are added and removed from the search results.  Research Angular animations.  See the video for an example implementation.
* Style the app.  It should look better than my implementation.

Bonus Features

* A user can choose to sort ascending or descending
* A user can favorite posts and view all favorites in a separate tab
* A user can upload an image(no backend involved)
